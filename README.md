# B-tree Implementation

A parameterized B-tree implemented in C++ supporting efficient search, insertion, and deletion.

## Features

- Implements a B-tree of variable order, handling node splitting and rebalancing to maintain efficiency.
- Supports dynamic insertions, deletions, and key redistribution in both leaf and internal nodes.
- Uses custom node structures with parent pointers and dynamic management of keys and children.
- Includes analysis of operation correctness and complexity relative to tree height and order.
