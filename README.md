# B-tree Implementation

A C++ implementation of a parameterized B-tree supporting dynamic data storage and retrieval.

### Features
- Implemented a fully parameterized B-tree supporting efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations for dynamic datasets.  
- Managed node splitting, key redistribution, and tree rebalancing for both leaf and internal nodes to maintain optimal performance.  
- Designed custom node structures with parent pointers and dynamic key/child arrays for flexible memory management.  
- Analyzed and verified the correctness of operations, and evaluated time and space complexity relative to B-tree order and height.
